The average of the sum, also known as the average is (1+1)/2 = 1 and the sum of the averages is 1/1 + 1/1 = 2).<br>2) I&#39;d argue that in this case, we do not even observe an average. It is more like the sum of all vectors (or complex numbers) the rotating arrow takes on. They just acancel each other out and therefore are in almost all cases 0. This therefore seemslike the average but isn&#39;t.<br>Apart from that, great video!\n",
